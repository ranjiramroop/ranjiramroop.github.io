                Who's the 25 year old going through another job change within 3 years of graduating college? That's right, it's Ranji! 
                From Real Estate Agent, to Digital Banking Tech Support, now to Full Stack Web Development. That's right, coding is my new game! 
                How did I end up here? Probably mental stimulation. Or maybe it was the constant ads I saw while scrolling through Instagram to go to the U of M's Coding Boot Camp. 
                Whichever one it was, web development is where new information is constantly available for me to learn and apply. Technology will continue to evolve, and I want to keep up. This is my way of doing that.

                Seriousness aside, I'm an occasional social butterfly who likes to recharge my social batteries in solitude.  I am a washed up ultimate frisbee player. I used to play in college and now I do not actively play the sport anymore. That's mostly because I was a little reckless on the field by overdoing it with the big layout diving catches. In other words, I injured myself often. Ah, the glory years.
                Now, I don't run anymore because it causes me to lose weight too fast! Woe is me, the ectomorph with the fast metabolism. 
                As a big food lover, this comes in handy! When I take time off from work, I like to travel. I find that the best way to immerse myself in the local culture is by eating the local cuisine.

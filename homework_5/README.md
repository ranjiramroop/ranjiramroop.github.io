#  The Business Hour Planner
## Purpose
This planner is useful for organizing, and visualizing our tasks that we may have during general business hours of 9am-5pm.
Store your schedule for that day, and overwrite it if needed! A handy color display allows you to visualize what is approaching for future hours, what is currently scheduled, and what has already past. 

## Usage
Future hours are designated in a green background color
